DOUBTS:  
  
  for EX6:
    - IDK if the parity should be activated when 
    the number of the active columns is odd or pair "the default now is pair"
    - It's kinda confusing that the start index on the statement of the exercice is 1,
    because IDK if I use 0 to 21 or 1 to 22 on practice, it feels more likely to be 0, 
    so it starts in 30 not 31
    - why the system library is imported ?!!
    - the activated pixel should be inperciptible?

  for EX7:
    - this just reverse the EX6, use chr() in place of ord(),
    in order to get the ascii interpretation
  
  for EX8:
    - this practically a test for EX7 so if you have EX7 you have EX8
